# Bhashini Project Frontend

This project was generated with Vite and React and uses TailwindCSS for styling. I have used the backend API that I made using Bhashini's SDK to transtate the text.

## Development server

Run `npm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
